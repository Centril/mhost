.SH NAME
.PP

parallel and compares results.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
mhost is a not so simple utility for performing DNS lookups.
It is designed to use multiple DNS servers in parallel and combine their
answers.
In this way, it is easy to troubleshot DNS issues or even spot DNS
server misconfigurations.
.PP
mhost comes with a predefined set of public DNS servers and can load DNS
servers from the ungefiltert\-surfen.de project which maintains large
lists of public DNS servers per country \- see
\f[I]https://public\-dns.info/\f[] for further information.
The default of mhost is to use the all local DNS servers listed in
\f[I]/etc/resolv.conf\f[].
.PP
mhost\[aq]s output is colorized if supported by the terminal and can be
controlled by several output modules.
Currently, the default is a summary of all received responses.
It also runs certain checks on the data, i.e., compares the serial
numbers of SOA records.
A detailed output shows the answers by each responding servers.
These two output modules also support a human\-friendly output in which
case times and durations are shown as relative times as well as semantic
output of certain resource records.
Further, JSON output allows for easy automatic processing of the answers
from scripts etc.
.PP
mhost uses UDP as transport protocol.
Since UDP is an unreliable protocol, DNS queries and DNS responses may
get lost.
The likelihood for losses increases with the amount of servers used so
it is not uncommon to get way less responses than DNS servers queried.
Keep this in mind when using large amount of DNS server, for example,
when using ungefiltert\-surfen.de lists.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[I]DOMAIN_NAME\f[]
Sets the domain name to lookup up.
.RS
.PP
mhost preprocesses the domain name before constructing queries.
For this purpose \f[I]/etc/resolv.conf\f[] is read for \f[I]ndots\f[]
and \f[I]domain\f[] configurations.
If \f[I]DOMAIN_NAME\f[] contains less \[aq].\[aq] then defined by
\f[I]ndots\f[] and a \f[I]domain\f[] is set, \f[I]domain\f[] is appended
to the domain name.
See also \f[C]\-S\f[].
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]IP_ADDR\f[]
Sets a dotted\-decimal IPv4 address or a colon\-delimited IPv6 address
to lookup in which case a PTR query is performed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h
Enabled human\-readable output for output modules supporting this
setting.
Currently, their us human\-readable support for SPF records as well as
all times and durations as relative times.
This examples show the output with and without human\-readable output
enabled:

.B \-o, \-\-output \f[I]module_name\f[] ...
Selects the output module to use.
Currently three modules are available: summary, details, json.
This option can be used multiple times to select multiple modules.
It is up to you make any sense of this.
.RS
.PP
The summary output module is the default output module and summarizes
all received results.
The first line shows how many results from how many servers have been
received as well as how the minimum and maximum amout of resource record
from each server.
Each resource record is printed with the amount of received answers in
parenthesis.
In this example, 20 answers have been received from 20 servers:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Received\ 20\ (min\ 2,\ max\ 2\ records)\ answers\ from\ 20\ servers
*\ IPv4:\ 93.184.216.34\ (20)
*\ IPv6:\ 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946\ (20)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The summary output module also prints alerts if certain checks on the
collected records fail.
Currently, the serial numbers of SOA records are compared and an alert
is shown if they diverge like in this example where two different serial
numbers have been reported by the queried servers:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Received\ 20\ (min\ 1,\ max\ 1\ records)\ answers\ from\ 20\ servers\ and\ found\ 1\ alert.
*\ SOA:\ origin\ NS\ sns.dns.icann.org.,\ responsible\ party\ noc.dns.icann.org.,\ serial\ 2017042801,\ refresh\ 7200\ sec,\ retry\ 3600\ sec,\ expire\ 1209600\ sec,\ min\ 3600\ sec\ (17)
*\ SOA:\ origin\ NS\ sns.dns.icann.org.,\ responsible\ party\ noc.dns.icann.org.,\ serial\ 2017042802,\ refresh\ 7200\ sec,\ retry\ 3600\ sec,\ expire\ 1209600\ sec,\ min\ 3600\ sec\ (3)
Alert
*\ SOA\ serial\ numbers\ diverge:\ {2017042802:\ 3,\ 2017042801:\ 17}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The details output module presents the received resource records for
each server together with the corresponding TTL.
In this example, the answers of two servers are printed.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
DNS\ server\ 8.8.8.8\ responded\ with
*\ IPv4:\ 93.184.216.34\ [expires\ in\ 3108\ sec]
*\ IPv6:\ 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946\ [expires\ in\ 3194\ sec]
DNS\ server\ 8.8.4.4\ responded\ with
*\ IPv4:\ 93.184.216.34\ [expires\ in\ 4836\ sec]
